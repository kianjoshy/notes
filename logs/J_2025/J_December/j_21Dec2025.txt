Just woke up and I want to reflect upon yesterday. Yesterday was overall not a great day. I had an overwhelming sense of dread that something was gonna go wrong. I'm not sure if it was medication or something but it felt really bad. Late that day when I jump roped all of those feelings went away magically. I think I need to implement some sort of workout routine as it overall increases my mood. I tend to not like to lift heavy and prefer more cardio type 
activities.

Robyns mood is really rotten today. I don't know why she is always unhappy and changing her mind on whether she wants to move out or not. I'm probably just gonna find a normal job or something to make her happy. It's really annoying. I don't know if it's whether or not she is just unhappy with the living situation or something else is going on. Even things other than the living situation seems to set her off and its really frustrating. I don't know what to do about it or if she will ever be happy. Why does she get to crash out and I'm the one that has to take it and calm her down? I'm the one experiencing set backs , do I really need to be with someone that doesn't support me? I don't appreciate the ways she treats me and I don't think she realizes it accumulates and I've been at my breaking point for awhile now. 
I'm quite burnt out and I've expressed this to her and I am asking for her support. And she just conveniently forgets. I'm even seeing therapy now and she doesn't realize how hurt I've been. If she doesn't support me during our lows, how can I trust her during our highs?
