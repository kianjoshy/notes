First time creating a second file. Proud of the result that it created a fresh new one for a new day. Definitely looking forward to continue to journal in this program. Next step is to create a GUI to have different types of notes so I can have one for my feelings and one for experiment 
observations.

Been feeling a sense of existential dread since this morning. Like something will go wrong no matter what I do. Motivation has been very low and feels sad the whole morning. Hope things improve.
