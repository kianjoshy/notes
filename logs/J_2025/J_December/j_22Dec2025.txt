Started a new day, couldn't reflect upon yesterday because I wasn't feeling so hot. Yesterday was a ton better, Robyn apologized for what she said yesterday. She seems to be aware about how she lashed out and how she acted. It feels like every weekend I'm the recipient of it though. It's not fair.  Whatever. Yesterday I didn't get as much programming done as I wish I did because I wasn't feeling good. Maybe another onset of a nose infection? Who knows, I decided to hold off on going to the urgent care till tomorrow. 
Sitting in this discord call pisses me off. In fact I just retreated to the bed. I don't feel like unpacking my feelings but I will anyway. People complaining about their work is so irritating. I fucking hate it. 
I played some Elden ring but it felt wrong since I'm being unproductive. I can't enjoy anything anymore.

Robyn once again is crashing out as always. Im sitting here, not feeling well so I don't really have the bandwidth to reassure her. It's getting really tiring. I don't know how much I can take it.
Whatever, it's not like when I get a job she will magically feel better but I'm gonna do it anyway. She needs to figure it out.
