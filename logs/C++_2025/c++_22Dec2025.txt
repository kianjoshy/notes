Four regions of memory,
First is where the program holds executablee code 
Memory for global variables
Then stack and heap.

Stack holds return addresses of function calls
Arguments to functions and local variables. 

Heap is region of free memory that program can use
C dynamic memory allocation

Program code --> global variables --> heap --> <-- stack
 
Source code : what you can read
Object code : translation of source code to machine code
Linker : output of linker is .exe
Library : functions that can use
Compile time
Run time: time program is executing

Five data types
Char, int, float, double, and void

Char is 1 byte
Int is 16 / 32 bits
Char uses ASCII 
Float double : 

Int main(){}
// comment

#include <iostream>

Int maint(){
	std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
}


#include <--- instructs compiler to include declarations for print


#include <iostream>

Using namespace std;

Double square(double x)
{
	return x*x
}

Void print_square(double)

Void function ()
// means function does not return value

Declaration is a statement that introduces an entity into the program
Specifies type for entity
Object - memory that holds value of some type 
Value - set of bits interpreted according to a the
Variable is named object.
