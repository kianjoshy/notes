I need to reconnect with my mind and body. Sharpen my mind with programming and math courses. Get a job, get a new card, cancel my old one, pause my debt.
Meanwhile I need to workout, preferably cardio type activities. Possibly will make python workout program to figure out a workout plan. Will possibly start on that tonight actually. 
Will start with isometric back holds and some running and core exercises and lower back.
