I need to get smarter, spend less time on distractions and more on reading books related to quantitative trading. Looks like I need to learn statistics which is good because I'm taking that in the winter. 
My plan is to create tools for myself to help automate my life and become more familiar with programming and its conventions. As for quant trading, I want to incorporate more NLP methods when it comes to making correct trades. This will start with me creating a virtual training model. I'm excited to see what I will learn from statistics and how I can apply what I've learned to it. 
Reading a book on data structures in python, not sure what I will get out of it but a reddit post mentioned that these concepts will be good to know. I can consider automating trading for my dad and working with him but I hate working with him. 
As for gaming/creating art work? The passion isn't there anymore, at least it's not as intense as before. I want to learn skills that will make me money for me and Robyn and this family and that's it. I was considering booting in art but the more I learn, the less appealing that becomes. I want to be an unstoppable academic weapon I know I can be.
